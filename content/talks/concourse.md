## Abstract

A reliable CI/CD pipeline is an important factors in agile software development. It allows for fast, automated and reliable builds as well as deployments. Jenkins was the way to go for most development teams. But with the rise of container technology and cloud native software, new challengers in the CI/CD server market arose.

We decided to use Concourse as our automation base. With it's cloud native approach and usage of containers as the foundation, it is a good match allowing us to build and deploy on demand.

This talk will show how Concourse works, how we use it in our daily work and sketch its future. Also I will share the experience we made in more then three years of working with Concourse.
