## Abstract

This talk is intended to describe the current possibilities to integrate java (and espacially popular frameworks like spring or micronaut) with the AI domain. It will show various options from framework-bound ones like SpringAI to provider-specific ways with Azure OpenAI SDK as well as generic abstractions like langchain4j. The talk demonstartes all these integrations with live demos as well as a real-world scenario based on a client project
