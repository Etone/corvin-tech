## Abstract

Kubernetes is the de-facto standard to run containerized applications in the cloud. But as simply as deploying a hello world application on kubernetes seems to be, running a production system on it is complex. Reducing this complexity is one of the major goals for any cloud native application.
One way to reduce complexity is to delegate as much as possible to kubernetes using Operators. Operators let you extend kubernetes with custom behaviour as well as custom resources.

In this talk, I want to show how one can use operators, how to implement them and what value Kubernetes Operators can bring to any cloud native journey.
