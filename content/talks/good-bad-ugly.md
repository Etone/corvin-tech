## Abstract

Kubernetes is here to stay, if you love it or hate it! But why do you hate it? Doesnâ€™t it solve all of your cloud problems?

As most of you know Kubernetes comes with an enourmous cost of complexity and a quite steep learning curve. Even when asking experts of the filed if they love or hate Kubernetes, they answers tend to show a love-hate relationship with the plattform.

In this talk I want to share with you reasons I found why Kubernetes can be confusing as well as show you the good, the bad and the ugly parts of the plattform
