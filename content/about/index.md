# Public Speaking - Sharing knowledge and experiences

In my career as IT Consultant and Software Engineer I was in the fortunate situation, that I could join conferences on company time. These experiences made me start my own journey as a public speaker, sharing my insights and experiences with others, particularly in the areas of **Cloud Native development**, **Kubernetes**, **CICD**, and most recently, **real-world applications of AI**.

By sharing what I’ve learned through hands-on projects and real-world projects, I’ve deepened my own understanding of the issues teams face when adopting new technologies. Engaging with Cloud Native communities has been invaluable, as it has allowed me to see how different teams approach common problems and how this drives innovation

More recently, I’ve been diving into Generative AI. I'm interessted in the ways AI Services like OpenAI, LLama or LangChain integrate into existing, business-case solving, applications and how this new approach generates value for customers and users.

If you’d like to know more about the talks I’ve given, feel free to check out my [list of presentations and topics](/talks)!
