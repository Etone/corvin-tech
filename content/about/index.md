# Public Speaking - Sharing knowledge and experiences

In my career as an IT Consultant and Software Engineer, I was fortunate to attend conferences on company time. These experiences made me start my own journey as a public speaker, sharing my insights and experiences, particularly in the areas of **Cloud Native development**, **Kubernetes**, **CICD**, and **real-world applications of AI**.

Engaging with Cloud Native communities has been invaluable. It has allowed me to see how different teams approach common problems and how this drives innovation.

More recently, I’ve been diving into Generative AI. I’m interested in the ways AI Services like OpenAI, LLama or LangChain integrate into existing applications and how this new approach generates value for users.

If you’d like to know more about the talks I’ve given, please check out my [list of presentations and topics!](/talks)

# Sabbatical - Learning about new cultures

From the moment I could decide, I spent my working time in tech, be it working as an IT Consultant, studying Software Engineering and  Distributed Systems, or completing a week-long internship at an IT  Service provider during school. I considered tech and IT my safe haven.

In 2020, I decided I needed to know if I’m in IT because I enjoy it or if I’m IT because I’m afraid to try something new. To find out I  applied for a six-month sabbatical, which started in 2023. Back then I  had no plan for what I wanted to do in these six months, in the years I made up my mind: I wanted to travel, first in Europe to visit all the places that made up the continent I grew up on and after that fulfilling a life-long dream of traveling to New Zealand.

Traveling in Europe made me appreciate the continent from another perspective. Be it the spiritual experience of visiting [Meteora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora) or the historic flair of Budapest, I still find myself falling back daydreaming about the journey I took.
