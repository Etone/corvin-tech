# Public Speaking

Sharing my Knowledge and my passion is very important to me. So i decided very early in my carrer to visit conferences not only to learn cool new technologies, but also to showcase my experiences in the topics **Cloud Enablement**, **Cloud Native Development**, **the broader Kuberneter eco system** and **Real world usecases of AI**. 

In my talks I focus on the team, sharing my experiences as well as showing life demonstrations of the topic. 

Recently, I have expanded my focus to AI usecases in the real world, showcasing how AI can be used in real applications and is not only a hype.
