## Idea
As I want to dive deeper into topics surrounding kuberetes, I decided to build a cloud platform, which handles all aspects of an development lifecycle as automatically as it gets, for more details, read the README in the repository. I will later write down current progress and Ideas, notes and what not here

## Current development state

Im really in the begingn of this. Currently there is basically more conceptual work of what is needed.

## Ideas for the future

- Add initial setup for first "Environment" with tools beeing hosted on
- Add Tekton, ArgoCD and Crossplane as first tools to allow developers to easily implement, test and deploy automatically to Kubernetes

## Used technology

Terraform
