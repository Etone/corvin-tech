## Idea
As I want to dive deeper into topics surrounding kubernetes, I decided to build a cloud platform, which handles all aspects of an development lifecycle as automatically as it gets, for more details, read the README in the repository. I will later write down current progress and Ideas, notes and what not here

## Current development state

Currently, there is a running version 0.1 of POD. A kubernetes cluster with some tooling configured and installed.
For more info, check the repository.

## Ideas for the future

- Add initial setup for first "Environment" with tools beeing hosted on
- Add Tekton, ArgoCD and Crossplane as first tools to allow developers to easily implement, test and deploy automatically to Kubernetes
